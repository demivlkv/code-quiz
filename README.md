# Project 4: Web APIs Challenge - Code Quiz
The primary goal for this project is to create a timed multiple-choice quiz from scratch, with HTML & CSS as the foundation and powered by Javascript & Web APIs. This quiz is intended for coding bootcamp students. The user is presented with a series of questions to test their knowledge of Javascript within 75 seconds. For every incorrect answer, 10 seconds is subtracted from the time remaining. Once all of the questions are answered or when the timers reaches 0, the user is then able to enter their initials and submit their score.
